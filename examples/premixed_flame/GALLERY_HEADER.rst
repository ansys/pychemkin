Premixed flame models
=====================

The *Premixed Flame* model is a 1-D steady-state application, and it contains two sub-models:
*"flame speed calculator"* (or the freely propagating flame model) and *"flat flame"* model.
The *flame speed calculator* is commonly used to calculate the laminar flame speed of a premixed
fuel-oxidizer mixture. The predicted/computed flame speeds can be used to validate a combustion
mechanism or can serve as a prre-processor to construct a "flame speed table" or a
"combustion progress table" for other applications. The *flat flame* burner-stablized model is
primarily used to study the flame chemistry in conjunction with the flat flame experiments.

The examples show different ways to perform the "premixed flame" calculations.
