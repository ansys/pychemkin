Shock tube reactor
===================

The *shock tube reactor* model is a 0-D transient reactor.
This ideal reactor model is normally used to reproduce the shock tube experiments
for chemical kinetics researches. The *incident shock* model predicts species profiles
behind the incident shock front which can be used to compare against corresponding experimental
data. Similarly, the *reflected shock* model complements the experiments for kinetics
researches at the high temperature conditions behind a reflected shock front. 

The examples will show the procedures of setting up an incident shock (with boundary layer
correction) simulation and a Zeldovich-von Neumann-Deoring (ZND) analysis of a combustible gas
mixture.
