Opposed-flow flame model
========================

The *opposed-flow Flame* model is a 1-D steady-state application to study
the structure of stretched flames in the opposed-flow configuration. It can also
be used to generate a "flamelet table" for CFD simulations. See the Chemkin
*Theory* manual for additional information about this feature.
