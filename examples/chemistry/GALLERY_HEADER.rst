Chemistry
=========

PyChemkin examples to demonstrate basic operations for
instantiating *Chemistry Set* from the gas-phase mechanism
and the thermodynamic/transport data files.

The examples walk through the steps about how to pre-process the
*Chemistry Set*, retrieve mechanism information and the species properties,
as well as how to handle multiple *Chemistry Sets* in a **Python Chemkin**
project.
