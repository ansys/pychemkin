Plug-flow reactor
=================

*Plug-Flow Reactor (PFR)* model is an idealized 1-D steady-state flow reactor model with single
inlet stream. The reactor pressure is assumed to be given, and the mass (flow rate) conservation
is maintained by the velocity change. The gas temperature along the reactor can be either specified
or solved by the energy equation.
