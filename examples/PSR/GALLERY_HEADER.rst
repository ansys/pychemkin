Perfectly stirred reactor
=========================

The *perfectly Stirred reactor (PSR)* model is a 0-D steady-state reactor.
This ideal reactor model assumes the gas mixture inside is uniform and
the properties of the outlet stream are exactly the same as the gas properties
inside the reactor. A PSR can have either its pressure or its volume "specified",
and the reactor temperature can either be solved from the energy equation or
be "given" as an input parameter.

The examples will show the procedures of setting up single PSR simulations with
different constraints and with multiple inlet streams.
