0-D engine models
=================

**PyChemkin** offers two types of 0-D engine models: the *Homogeneous Charged Compression Ignition (HCCI)* engine model
and the *Spark Ignition (SI)* engine model. These 0-D engine models simulate the combustion process (or the lack of, in case of a misfire)
inside an engine cylinder between the *Intake Valve Close (IVC)* and the *Exhaust Valve Open (EVO)* when the
cylinder is considered as a closed system. The Chemkin *Theory* manual has detailed descriptions of these 0-D engine models.

The examples show the steps of setting up simulations with different *Chemkin* engine models.
