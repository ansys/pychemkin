Batch reactor
=============

The *batch reactor* is an idealized 0-D transient closed reactor model in which the gas inside
the reactor is assumed to be homogeneous. When the pressure of the *batch reactor* is constrained,
the reactor volume would vary to conserve the total gas mass. Likewise, the reactor pressure might
change when the reactor volume is "given". The gas temperature can be "given" by piecewise linear
profile data or solved by the energy equation.

The examples consist of projects that utilize the *batch reactor* model to perform simulations of
various complexities, from tracking the evolution of the mixture properties to the A-factor sensitivity
analysis.
