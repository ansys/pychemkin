        "\n\n# Determine the impact of residence time on combustion in a PSR\n\nAnsys Chemkin offers some idealized reactor models commonly used for studying chemical\nprocesses and for developing reaction mechanisms. The PSR (perfectly stirred reactor) model is\na steady-state 0-D model of the open perfectly mixed gas-phase reactor. There is no limit on\nthe number of inlets to the PSR. As soon as the inlet gases enter the reactor, they are\nthoroughly mixed with the gas mixture inside. The PSR has only one outlet, and the outlet gas\nis assumed to be exactly the same as the gas mixture in the PSR. There are two basic types of\nPSR models:\n\n- **constrained-pressure** (or set residence time)\n- **constrained-volume**\n\nBy default, the PSR model is running under constant pressure. The PyChemkin PSR models\nalways require the connected inlets to be defined, that is, the total inlet flow rate to the PSR\nis always known. Therefore, either the residence time or the reactor volume is needed to\nsatisfy the basic setup of the PSR model.\n\nThis example specifies the reactor volume of the PSR. The residence time is calculated from the reactor volume and the total inlet volumetric flow rate.\n\nFor each type of PSR model, you can either specify the reactor temperature (as a fixed\nvalue or by a piecewise-linear profile) or solve the energy conservation equation. In total,\nyou get four variations of the PSR model.\n\nPSR models are mostly employed in chemical kinetics studies. By controlling the reactor\ntemperature, pressure, and/or residence time, you can gain knowledge about the major intermediates\nof a complex chemical process and postulate possible reaction pathways.\n\nThis example describes a parameter study of the influence of the PSR residence time on the hydrogen combustion process. It uses two inlet streams, one for the fuel mixture and the other for the air mixture. The fuel-to-air ratio inside the PSR is determined by the mass or the volumetric flow rate ratio of the two inlet streams.\n"
