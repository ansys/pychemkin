        "\n\n# Compute the laminar flame speed of diluted hydrogen at low pressure\n\nThe *freely propagating premixed flame* model can be utilized to obtain the\nlaminar *flame speed* of a gas mixture at given initial temperature and pressure.\nThe premixed flame model will calculate the temperature and species composition profiles\nacross the flame, and the laminar flame speed will be derived from the mass flow rate of\nthe gas mixture, a constant across the entire calculation domain because of the mass\nconservation.\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates the application of the \"freely propagating\" premixed flame model\nto calculate the laminar flame speed of an N\\ :sub:`2` diluted hydrogen-air mixture at\nlow pressure. Since the transport processes are critical for flame calculations, the\n*transport data* must be included in the mechanism data and pre-processed.\n"
