        "\n\n# Simulate a spark ignition engine\n\nAnsys chemkin offers some idealized internal combustion (IC) engine models commonly used\nfor fuel combustion and engine performance research. The Chemkin IC engine model is a specialized\ntransient 0-D closed gas-phase reactor that mainly performs combustion simulation between the\nintake valve closing (IVC) and the exhaust valve opening (EVO), that is, when the engine cylinder resembles a closed chamber. The cylinder volume is derived from the piston motion as a function of the engine crank angle (CA) and engine parameters such as engine speed (RPM) and stroke. The energy equation is always solved. There are several wall heat transfer models specifically designed for engine simulations.\n\n.. note ::\n    For additional information on Chemkin IC engine models, use the\n    ``ansys.chemkin.manuals()`` method to view the online **Theory** manual.\n\nThe Chemkin spark ignition (SI) engine model offers a simple way to simulate the chemical kinetics taking place in the spark ignition engine. The Chemkin SI engine model does not predict the fuel mass burning rate profile. On the contrary, it requires the burning rate profile as input in the form of the Wiebe function parameters, the burn profile anchor points, or normalized profile data. The main uses of the Chemkin SI engine model are conducting parameter studies of the burning rate profile on engine performance, emissions, and the onset of engine knock due to end gas autoignition.\n\nThis example shows how to set up and run the simplest Chemkin IC engine model, the SI engine model. In addition to the basic engine parameters, many engine model-specific features such as the\nexhaust gas recirculation and the wall heat transfer can be included in the engine simulation.\n"
