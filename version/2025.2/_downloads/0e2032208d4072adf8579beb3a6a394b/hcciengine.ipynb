        "\n\n# Simulate a single-zone HCCI engine\n\nAnsys Chemkin offers some idealized internal combustion (IC) engine models commonly used\nfor fuel combustion and engine performance research. The Chemkin IC engine model is a specialized\ntransient 0-D *closed* gas-phase reactor that mainly performs combustion simulation between the\nintake valve closing (IVC) and the exhaust valve opening (EVO), that is, when the engine cylinder resembles a closed chamber. The cylinder volume is derived from the piston motion as a function of the engine crank angle (CA) and engine parameters such as engine speed (RPM) and stroke. The energy equation is always solved, and there are several wall heat transfer models specifically designed for engine simulations.\n\n.. note ::\n    For additional information on Chemkin IC engine models, use the\n    ``ansys.chemkin.manuals()`` method to view the online **Theory** manual.\n\nThis example shows how to set up and run the simplest Chemkin IC engine model:\nthe single-zone homogeneous charged compression ignition (HCCI) engine model. In addition to the basic engine parameters, many engine model-specific features such as the *exhaust gas recirculation* and *wall heat transfer* can be included in the engine simulation.\n"
