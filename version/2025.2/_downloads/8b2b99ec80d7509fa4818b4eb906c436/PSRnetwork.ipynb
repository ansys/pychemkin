        "\n\n# Simulate a combustor using an equivalent reactor network with stream recycling\n\nThis example shows how to set up and solve an ERN (equivalent reactor network) in PyChemkin.\n\nAn ERN is employed as a reduced-order model to simulate the steady-state\ncombustion process inside a gas turbine combustor chamber. This reduced-order\nreactor network model retains the complexity of the combustion chemistry\nby sacrificing details of the combustor geometries, the spatial resolution,\nand the mass and energy transfer processes. An ERN usually comprises PSRs\n(perfectly-stirred reactors) and PFRs (plug-flow reactors).\nThe network configuration and connectivity, the reactor parameters,\nand the mass flow rates can be determined from \"hot\" steady-state CFD simulation results\nand/or from observations and measured data of the actual/similar devices.\nOnce a reactor network is calibrated against the experimental data of a gas combustor,\nit becomes a handy tool for quickly estimating the emissions from the combustor\nwhen it is subjected to certain variations in the fuel compositions.\n\nThis figure shows a proposed ERN model of a fictional gas turbine combustor.\n\n .. figure:: combustor_ERN.png\n   :scale: 80 %\n   :alt: Combustor reactor network\n\nThe *primary fuel* is mixed with the incoming air to form a *fuel-lean* mixture\nbefore entering the chamber through the primary inlet. Additional air, the *primary air*,\nis introduced to the combustion chamber separately through openings surrounding the primary inlet.\nThe *secondary air* is entrained into the combustion chamber through well-placed holes\non the liners at a location slightly downstream from the primary inlet.\n\nThe first PSR (reactor #1) represents the *mixing zone* around the main injector\nwhere the cool *premixed fuel-air* stream and the *primary air* stream are preheated\nby mixing with the hot combustion products from the *recirculation zone*.\n\nDownstream from PSR #1, PSR #2, the *flame zone* is where the combustion of\nthe heated fuel-air mixture takes place. The secondary air is injected here to cool down\nthe combustion exhaust before it exits the combustion chamber. A portion of the exhaust gas\ncoming out of PSR #2 does not leave the combustion chamber directly and is diverted to PSR #3,\nthe *recirculation zone*.\n\nThe majority of the outlet flow from PSR #3 is recirculated back to the flame zone to\nsustain the fuel-lean premixed flame there. The rest of the hot gas from PSR #3 travels\nfurther back to PSR #1, the mixing zone, to preheat the fuel-lean mixture just entering the combustion chamber.\nFinally, the cooled flue gas leaves the chamber in a stream-like manner. Typically, a PFR is applied to simulation of the outflow.\n\nThe reactors in the network are solved individually one by one. When there is a *tear stream* in the network,\nthe ERN should be solved iteratively. A tear stream is usually a *recycle\" stream* that can serve as\na pivot point for solving the recycle network iteratively. The convergence of the ERN is then determined\nby the absence of the per-iteration variation of the computed tear stream properties, such as species composition.\nIn the current project, the recycling streams from PSR #3 to PSR #1 and PSR #2 are tear streams.\n"
