        "\n\n# Predict the ignition delay time of a combustible mixture\n\nOne of the important properties of hydrocarbon fuels is the *ignition delay time*.\nFor automobiles, the gasoline, a mixtures of many fuel species, is graded by the\n*octane number* which is closely related to the fuel mixture's ignition characteristics.\nHigher octane number fuel tends to ignite more easily. However, this does not mean you\nshould blindly put the highest octane number fuel into your car. Car engines are designed\nfor specific operating conditions, and you should always use the gasoline grades recommended by\nthe car/engine manufacturer to prevent damages to the engine.\n\nThis tutorial employs the **constant-pressure batch reactor model** (with the energy equation\n**ON**) to predict the *auto-ignition delay time* of a **Primary Reference Fuel (PRF)**. PRF\nis created for automobile fuel researches and consists of two major components: n-heptane\nC\\ :sub:`7`\\ H\\ :sub:`16` and iso-octane C\\ :sub:`8`\\ H\\ :sub:`18`\\ . By definition, n-heptane\nis assigned with an octane number of 0, and an octane number of 100 for iso-octane. Thus, a PRF\nof 20% n-heptane and 80% iso-octane has an octane number of 80. In this tutorial, a PRF 60 fuel\nis used to show the **negative temperature coefficient (NTC)** behavior in the ignition delay\ncurve. The ignition delay curve is constructed by collecting the predicted auto-ignition delay\ntimes with various initial gas conditions. Here, the initial gas temperature is increased from\n700 to 1080 [K].\n"
