================================
Preprocess a gas-phase mechanism
================================

Before you can run a Chemkin simulation, you must load and preprocess the reaction
mechanism data. The mechanism data consists of a reaction mechanism input file,
a thermodynamic data file, and an optional transport data file.

This example shows how to instantiate and preprocess a chemistry set, which is
always the first task in running any PyChemkin simulation.

PyChemkin allows several chemistry sets to coexist in the same Python project.
However, only one chemistry set can be active at a time.

Create a chemistry set

The first mechanism to load is the GRI 3.0 mechanism for methane combustion.
This mechanism and its associated data files come with the standard Ansys Chemkin
installation in the ``/reaction/data`` directory.

Create a second chemistry set
=============================
The second mechanism to load into the project is the C2-NOx mechanism for
the combustion of C1-C2 hydrocarbons. This mechanism differs from the GRI mechanism
in the sense that it is self-contained, that is, the thermodynamic and transport data
of all species is included in the ``C2_NOx_SRK.inp`` mechanism input file, which sits in
the same reaction data directory as the GRI mechanism input files.

Use the same steps that were used to instantiate the first chemistry set to
process any set of reaction mechanism files. Here, use a slightly different procedure
to instantiate the second chemistry set. After you have created it, specify
the reaction mechanism files one by one. The reaction mechanism
file in this case contains all the necessary thermodynamic and transport data. Thus, there
is no need to specify thermodynamic and transport data files. However, an additional step is
required to instruct the preprocessor to include the transport data.
