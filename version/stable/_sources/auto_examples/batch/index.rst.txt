Batch reactor
=============

The *batch reactor* is an idealized 0-D transient closed reactor model in which the gas inside
the reactor is assumed to be homogeneous. When the pressure of the *batch reactor* is constrained,
the reactor volume would vary to conserve the total gas mass. Likewise, the reactor pressure might
change when the reactor volume is "given". The gas temperature can be "given" by piecewise linear
profile data or solved by the energy equation.

The examples consist of projects that utilize the *batch reactor* model to perform simulations of
various complexities, from tracking the evolution of the mixture properties to the A-factor sensitivity
analysis.

For automobiles, the gasoline, a mixtures of many fuel species, is graded by the octane number which is closely related to the fuel mixture&#x27;s ignition characteristics. Higher octane number fuel tends to ignite more easily. However, this does not mean you should blindly put the highest octane number fuel into your car. Car engines are designed for specific operating conditions, and you should always use the gasoline grades recommended by the car/engine manufacturer to prevent damages to the engine.">
