        "\n\n# Use a chain reactor network to model a gas combustor\n\nThis example shows how to set up and solve a series of linked PSRs (perfectly-stirred reactors).\nThis is the simplest reactor network as it does not contain any recycling streams or\noutflow splittings.\n\nHere is a PSR chain model of a fictional gas combustor:\n\n .. figure:: chain_reactor_network.png\n   :scale: 80 %\n   :alt: Chain reactor network\n\nThe primary inlet stream to the first reactor, the *combustor*, is the fuel-lean methane-air mixture\nthat is formed by mixing the fuel (methane) and the heated air. The exhaust from the combustor\nenters the second reactor, the *dilution zone*, where the hot combustion products are cooled by\nthe introduction of additional cool air. The cooled and diluted gas mixture in the dilution zone then\ntravel to the third reactor, the *reburning zone*. A mixture of fuel (methane) and carbon dioxide is injected\nto the gas in the reburning zone, attempting to convert any remaining carbon monoxide or nitric oxide\nin the exhaust gas to carbon dioxide or nitrogen, respectively.\n\nThis example uses the ``ReactorNetwork`` module to configure and solve this chain reactor network.\nThis module automatically handles the tasks of running the individual reactors and setting up\nthe inlet to the downstream reactor.\n"
