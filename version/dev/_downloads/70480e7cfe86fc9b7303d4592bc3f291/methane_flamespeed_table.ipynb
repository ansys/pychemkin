        "\n\n# Construct atmospheric  methane-air flame speed versus equivalence ratio table\n\nOne of the prevailing use case of the *freely propagating premixed flame* model is\nto build a *flame speed* table to be imported by another combustion simulation tools.\nPyChemkin provides the flexibility to customize the data structure of the flame speed table\ndepending on the simulation goals and the tool. Furthermore, over the years, the chemkin\nflame speed calculator has derived a set of default solver settings that would greatly improve\nthe convergence performance, especially for those widely adopted hydrocarbon fuel\ncombustion mechanisms. The required input parameters the flame speed calculator are reduced\nto the composition of the fuel-oxidizer mixture, the initial/inlet pressure and temperature,\nand the calculation domain.\n\nThis tutorial shows the \"minimal\" effort to create a flame speed table of CH\\ :sub:`4`\\ -air mixtures\nat the atmospheric pressure. The predicted flame speed values are compared against the experimental data\nas a function of the mixture equivalence ratio. Since the transport processes are critical for flame\ncalculations, the transport data must be included in the mechanism data and preprocessed.\n"

When running into these situations, start\nthe parameter runs from the stoichiometric condition and go down the lean and/or the rich branch.

However, by doing this, the later runs will contain a lot of grid points\n    accumulated from all previous runs.\n  - Use the ``set_molefractions`` method to update the inlet gas composition before each run. Similarly,\n    use the ``pressure`` and the ``temperature`` methods to change the inlet condition.</p></div>\n\n\n"
