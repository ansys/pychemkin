        "\n\n# Calculate the heating values of fuel mixtures\n\nOne of the advantages of PyChemkin is flexibility. You can establish your own\nworkflow with PyChemkin to meet your simulation goals. This tutorial is an example\nof building a specialized algorithm to calculate the *heating values*, the lower heating\nvalue (LHV) and the higher heating value (HHV), of fuel mixtures.\n\nThe **heating value** is the net heat release from the complete combustion of a hydrocarbon\n(HC) in oxygen at the standard state condition (298.15 [K] and 1 [atm]). The combustion products\nare mainly CO\\ :sub:`2` and H\\ :sub:`2`\\ O, and are assumed to be cooled back to the standard state\ncondition in the heating value calculation. The difference between the lower heating value\nand the higher heating value is the final form of the H\\ :sub:`2`\\ O; the water is in *gas phase*\nfor the *lower* heating value, and in *liquid phase* for the *higher* heating value. You can\nsee that the higher heating value can be obtained by adding the water *heat of vaporization* to the\nlower heating value. Thus, the workflow for calculating the heating values of any HC fuels consists of\ntwo main steps:\n\n    1. Calculating the water heat of vaporization at the standard state condition: this can be done\n    by getting the value from a well trusted database or by using the **chemkin** trick described below.\n\n    2. Calculating the heat of combustion of the fuel mixture in pure oxygen: here you will use the\n    ``Find_Equilibrium`` method with the *fixed pressure* and *fixed temperature* option (the default setting).\n\nThe lower heating value is the enthalpy different between the fresh fuel and oxygen mixture and the final product\nmixture. Adding the heat of vaporization to the lower heating value, and you get the higher heating value.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will compute the heating values of some pure fuel species such as methane and n-butane\nas well as some fuel mixtures such as PRF RON 80 and biodiesel. You can compare the values you get here with\nthe known values from a trusty database.\n"
