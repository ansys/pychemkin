        "\n\n# Use a chain of individual reactors to model a gas combustor\n\nThis example shows how to set up and solve a series of linked PSRs (perfectly-stirred reactors).\nThis is the simplest reactor network as it does not contain any recycling streams or\noutflow splittings.\n\nHere is the PSR chain model of a fictional gas combustor.\n\n .. figure:: chain_reactor_network.png\n   :scale: 80 %\n   :alt: Chain reactor network\n\nThe primary inlet stream to the first reactor, the *combustor*, is the fuel-lean methane-air mixture\nthat is formed by mixing the fuel (methane) and the heated air. The exhaust from the combustor\nenters the second reactor, the *dilution zone*, where the hot combustion products are cooled by\nthe introduction of additional cool air. The cooled and diluted gas mixture in the *dilution zone* then\ntravels to the third reactor, the *reburning zone*. A mixture of fuel (methane) and carbon dioxide is\ninjected to the gas in the reburning zone, attempting to convert any remaining carbon monoxide or\nnitric oxide in the exhaust gas to carbon dioxide or nitrogen, respectively.\n\nThis example solves the reactors one by one, from upstream to downstream. Once the solution of the\nupstream reactor is obtained, it is used to set up the external inlet of the immediate downstream reactor.\nThis process continues until all reactors in the chain network are solved. Since there is no recycling stream\nin this configuration, the entire reactor network can be solved in one sweep.\n"
