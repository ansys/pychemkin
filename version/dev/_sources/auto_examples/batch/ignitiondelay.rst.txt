========================================================
Predict the ignition delay time of a combustible mixture
========================================================

One of the important properties of hydrocarbon fuels is the *ignition delay time*.
For automobiles, the gasoline, a mixtures of many fuel species, is graded by the
*octane number* which is closely related to the fuel mixture's ignition characteristics.
Higher octane number fuel tends to ignite more easily. However, this does not mean you
should blindly put the highest octane number fuel into your car. Car engines are designed
for specific operating conditions, and you should always use the gasoline grades recommended by
the car/engine manufacturer to prevent damages to the engine.

This tutorial employs the **constant-pressure batch reactor model** (with the energy equation
**ON**) to predict the *auto-ignition delay time* of a **Primary Reference Fuel (PRF)**. PRF
is created for automobile fuel researches and consists of two major components: n-heptane
C\ :sub:`7`\ H\ :sub:`16` and iso-octane C\ :sub:`8`\ H\ :sub:`18`\ . By definition, n-heptane
is assigned with an octane number of 0, and an octane number of 100 for iso-octane. Thus, a PRF
of 20% n-heptane and 80% iso-octane has an octane number of 80. In this tutorial, a PRF 60 fuel
is used to show the **negative temperature coefficient (NTC)** behavior in the ignition delay
curve. The ignition delay curve is constructed by collecting the predicted auto-ignition delay
times with various initial gas conditions. Here, the initial gas temperature is increased from
700 to 1080 [K].

Create a chemistry set
===================================
For PRF, the encrypted 14-component gasoline mechanism, ``gasoline_14comp_WBencrypted.inp``,
is used. ``gasoline`` is the name given to this ``Chemistry Set``.

.. note::
  This gasoline mechanism does not come with any transport data so you do not need to provide
  the transport data file.

Pre-process the gasoline ``Chemistry Set``
==========================================

.. code-block:: Python


    # preprocess the mechanism files
    iError = gasoline.preprocess()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-119

Set up the stoichiometric gasoline-air mixture
==============================================
You need to set up the stoichiometric gasoline-air mixture for the subsequent
ignition delay time calculations. Here the ``X_by_Equivalence_Ratio``method is used.
You create the ``fuel`` and the ``air`` mixtures first. Then define the
*complete combustion product species* and provide the *additives* composition if applicable.
And finally you can simply set ``equivalenceratio=1`` to create the stoichiometric
gasoline-air mixture.

For PRF 60 gasoline, the ``recipe`` is ``[("ic8h18", 0.6), ("nc7h16", 0.4)]``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 119-151

.. code-block:: Python


    # create the fuel mixture
    fuelmixture = ck.Mixture(gasoline)
    # set fuel = composition of PRF 60
    fuelmixture.X = [("ic8h18", 0.6), ("nc7h16", 0.4)]
    # setting pressure and temperature
    fuelmixture.pressure = 5.0 * ck.P_ATM
    fuelmixture.temperature = 1500.0

    # create the oxidizer mixture: air
    air = ck.Mixture(gasoline)
    air.X = [("o2", 0.21), ("n2", 0.79)]
    # setting pressure and temperature
    air.pressure = 5.0 * ck.P_ATM
    air.temperature = 1500.0

    # products from the complete combustion of the fuel mixture and air
    products = ["co2", "h2o", "n2"]
    # species mole fractions of added/inert mixture. can also create an additives mixture here
    add_frac = np.zeros(gasoline.KK, dtype=np.double)  # no additives: all zeros

        print("Error: Failed to create the fuel-oxidizer mixture.")

    premixed.temperature = 700.0


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 161-169

Create the reactor object for ignition delay time calculations
==============================================================
Use the ``GivenPressureBatchReactor_EnergyConservation`` method to instantiate a
*constant pressure batch reactor that also includes the energy equation*. This ``ReactorModel``
method requires a ``Mixture`` object as an input parameter. This ``Mixture`` input serves two
purposes: passing the ``Chemistry Set`` to be used by the reactor model and setting the
*initial condition* (pressure, temperature, and gas composition) of the simulation. You
should use the ``premixed`` mixture you just created.

.. code-block:: Python


    MyCONP = GivenPressureBatchReactor_EnergyConservation(premixed, label="CONP")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 173-178

Set up additional reactor model parameters
==========================================
*Reactor parameters*, *solver controls*, and *output instructions* need to be provided
before running the simulations. For a batch reactor, the *initial volume* and the
*simulation end time* are required inputs.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 178-188

.. code-block:: Python


    # verify initial gas composition inside the reactor
    MyCONP.list_composition(mode="mole")

    # set other reactor parameters
    # initial reactor volume [cm3]
    MyCONP.volume = 10.0
    # simulation end time [sec]
    MyCONP.time = 1.0


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 189-207

Set output options
==================
You can turn on the *adaptive solution saving* to resolve the steep variations in the solution
profile. Here additional solution data point will be saved for every **100 [K]** change in gas
**temperature**. The ``set_ignition_delay`` method must be included for the reactor model to
report the *ignition delay times* after the simulation is done. If ``method="T_inflection"`` is
set, the reactor model will treat the *inflection points* in the predicted gas temperature profile
as the indication of an auto-ignition. You can choose a different auto-ignition definition.

.. note::
  Type ``ansys.chemkin.show_ignition_definitions()`` to get the list of all available ignition
  delay time definitions in Chemkin.

.. note::
  By default, time intervals for both print and save solution are **1/100** of the
  *simulation end time*. In this case :math:`dt=time/100=0.001`\ . You can change them
  to different values.

Set solver controls
===================
You can overwrite the default solver controls by using solver related methods, for example,
``tolerances``.

Run the parameter study
=======================
Construct the ignition delay curve by varying the initial reactor temperature in 20 [K]
increments from 700 to 1080 [K]. Use the ``get_ignition_delay`` method to extract the ignition
delay times after finishing each run.

Plot the ignition delay curve
=============================
The ignition delay curve is customarily plotted against the inverse temperature. The corresponding
temperature values are shown on the top axis.

Intuitively, you expect that the reactivity increases as the temperature increases. However, as
you can see, in this case, the ignition delay curve does not vary monotonically with the
temperature. Between 850 and 950 [K], the ignition delay time actually increases slightly
(because the reactivity decreases). This is regarded as the
**Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC)** behavior which is often observed during
low-temperature oxidation of large hydrocarbon fuels.
