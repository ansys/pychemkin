==============================================================================
Simulate a combustor using an equivalent reactor network with stream recycling
==============================================================================

This example shows how to set up and solve an ERN (equivalent reactor network) in PyChemkin.

An ERN is employed as a reduced-order model to simulate the steady-state
combustion process inside a gas turbine combustor chamber. This reduced-order
reactor network model retains the complexity of the combustion chemistry
by sacrificing details of the combustor geometries, the spatial resolution,
and the mass and energy transfer processes. An ERN usually comprises PSRs
(perfectly-stirred reactors) and PFRs (plug-flow reactors).
The network configuration and connectivity, the reactor parameters,
and the mass flow rates can be determined from "hot" steady-state CFD simulation results
and/or from observations and measured data of the actual/similar devices.
Once a reactor network is calibrated against the experimental data of a gas combustor,
it becomes a handy tool for quickly estimating the emissions from the combustor
when it is subjected to certain variations in the fuel compositions.

This figure shows a proposed ERN model of a fictional gas turbine combustor.

The *primary fuel* is mixed with the incoming air to form a *fuel-lean* mixture
before entering the chamber through the primary inlet. Additional air, the *primary air*,
is introduced to the combustion chamber separately through openings surrounding the primary inlet.
The *secondary air* is entrained into the combustion chamber through well-placed holes
on the liners at a location slightly downstream from the primary inlet.

The first PSR (reactor #1) represents the *mixing zone* around the main injector
where the cool *premixed fuel-air* stream and the *primary air* stream are preheated
by mixing with the hot combustion products from the *recirculation zone*.

Downstream from PSR #1, PSR #2, the *flame zone* is where the combustion of
the heated fuel-air mixture takes place. The secondary air is injected here to cool down
the combustion exhaust before it exits the combustion chamber. A portion of the exhaust gas
coming out of PSR #2 does not leave the combustion chamber directly and is diverted to PSR #3,
the *recirculation zone*.

The majority of the outlet flow from PSR #3 is recirculated back to the flame zone to
sustain the fuel-lean premixed flame there. The rest of the hot gas from PSR #3 travels
further back to PSR #1, the mixing zone, to preheat the fuel-lean mixture just entering the combustion chamber.
Finally, the cooled flue gas leaves the chamber in a stream-like manner. Typically, a PFR is applied to simulation of the outflow.

The reactors in the network are solved individually one by one. When there is a *tear stream* in the network,
the ERN should be solved iteratively. A tear stream is usually a *recycle" stream* that can serve as
a pivot point for solving the recycle network iteratively. The convergence of the ERN is then determined
by the absence of the per-iteration variation of the computed tear stream properties, such as species composition.
In the current project, the recycling streams from PSR #3 to PSR #1 and PSR #2 are tear streams.

Create external inlet streams from the mixtures
===============================================
Create the ``fuel`` and the ``air`` streams/mixtures before setting up the
external inlet streams. The fuel in this case is pure methane. The
``X_by_Equivalence_Ratio()`` method is used to form the main
``premixed`` inlet stream to the *mixing zone* reactor. The external inlets
to the first reactor, the *mixing zone*, and the second reactor, the *flame zone*, are simply
``air`` mixtures with different mass flow rates and temperatures.

.. note::
  PyChemkin has *air* redefined as a convenient way to set up the air
  stream/mixture in the simulations. Use the ``ansys.chemkin.Air.X()`` or
  ``ansys.chemkin.Air.Y()`` method when the mechanism uses ``O2`` and ``N2`` for
  oxygen and nitrogen. Use the ``ansys.chemkin.air.X()`` or ``ansys.chemkin.air.Y()``
  method when oxygen and nitrogen are represented by ``o2`` and ``n2``.

Define reactors in the reactor network
======================================
Set up the PSR for each zone one by one with *external inlets only*.
For PSRs, use the ``set_inlet()`` method to add the external inlets to the
reactor. A PFR always requires one external inlet when it is instantiated.
From upstream to downstream, they are ``premix zone``, ``flame zone``, and
``recirculation zone``. The ``recirculation zone`` does not have an external inlet.

.. note::
  PyChemkin requires that the first reactor/zone must have at least
  one external inlet. Because the rest of the reactors have at least the
  through-flow from the immediate upstream reactor, they do not require
  an external inlet.

.. note::
  The stream parameter used to instantiate a PSR is used to establish
  the *guessed reactor solution* and is modified when the network is solved by
  the ERN.

Create the reactor network
==========================
Create a hybrid reactor network named ``PSRnetwork`` and add the reactors one
by one from upstream to downstream using the ``add_reactor()`` method. For a
simple chain network you do not need to define the connectivity among the reactors.
The reactor network model automatically figures out the through-flow connections.

.. note::

  - Use the ``show_reactors()`` method to get the list of reactors in the network in
    the order that they are added.
  - Use the ``remove_reactor()`` method to remove an existing reactor from the
    network by the reactor ``name/label``. Similarly, use the ``clear_connections()``
    method to undo the network connectivity.
  - The order of the reactor addition is important as it dictates the solution
    sequence and thus the convergence rate.

    PSRnetwork.add_reactor(flame)
    PSRnetwork.add_reactor(recirculation)

    # list the reactors in the network
    PSRnetwork.show_reactors()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 295-320

Define the PSR connectivity
===========================
Because the current reactor network contains recycling streams, for example, from PSR #3 to
PSR #1 and PSR #2, you must explicitly specify the network connectivity. To do this, you use
a *split* dictionary to define the outflow connections among the PSRs in the network.
The *key* of the split dictionary is the label of the *originate PSR*. The *value* is a
list of tuples consisting of the label of the *target PSR* and its mass flow rate fraction.

::

  { "originate PSR" : [("target PSR1", fraction), ("target PSR2", fraction)],
    "another originate PSR" : [("target PSR1", fraction), ... ], ... }

For example, the outflow from reactor ``PSR1``is split into two streams. 90% of the
mass flow rate goes to ``PSR2`` and the rest is diverted to ``PSR5``. The split dictionary entry for
the outflow split of ``PSR1`` is as follows:

::

  "PSR1" : [("PSR2", 0.9), ("PSR5", 0.1)]

.. note::
  The outlet flow from a reactor that is leaving the reactor network must be labeled as ``EXIT>>``
  when you define the outflow splitting.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 320-333

.. code-block:: Python


    # PSR #1 outlet flow splitting
    split_table = [(flame.label, 1.0)]
    PSRnetwork.add_outflow_connections(mix.label, split_table)
    # PSR #2 outlet flow splitting
    # part of the outlet flow from PSR #2 exits the reactor network
    split_table = [(recirculation.label, 0.2), ("EXIT>>", 0.8)]
    PSRnetwork.add_outflow_connections(flame.label, split_table)
    # PSR #3 outlet flow splitting
    # PSR #3 is the last reactor of the network. However, it does not have an external outlet.
    split_table = [(mix.label, 0.15), (flame.label, 0.85)]
    PSRnetwork.add_outflow_connections(recirculation.label, split_table)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 334-347

Define the tear point for the iteration
=======================================
Because the reactor network contains recycling streams, it must be
solved iteratively by applying the *tear stream* method. You use the
``add_tearingpoint() `` method to explicitly define the *tear points*
of the network. In this example, the stream recycling
occurs at reactor #3, where the outlet flow is sent back to
the upstream reactors, reactor #1 and reactor #2. Therefore, reactor
#3, the *recirculation zone*, should be set as the only tear point of
this reactor network. You use the ``set_tear_tolerance()`` method
to set the relative tolerance for the overall reactor network convergence.
The default tolerance is 1.0e-6.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 347-354

.. code-block:: Python


    # define the tear point reactor as reactor #3
    PSRnetwork.add_tearingpoint(recirculation.label)

    # reset the network relative tolerance
    PSRnetwork.set_tear_tolerance(1.0e-5)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 355-370

Solve the reactor network
=========================
Use the ``run()`` method to solve the entire reactor network. The ``ReactorNetwork`` hybrid
solves the reactors one by one in the order that they are added to the network.

.. note::
  Use the ``set_tear_iteration_limit(count)`` method to change the limit on the number of
  tear loop iterations that can be taken before declaring failure.
  The default limit is 200.

.. note::
  The ``set_relaxation_factor(factor)`` method can be employed to make solution updating at the
  end of each iteration to be more aggressive (factor > 1.0) or more conservative (factor < 1.0).
  By default, the relaxation factor is set to 1.

        exit()

    runtime = time.time() - start_time
    print()
    print(f"Total simulation duration: {runtime} [sec].")
    print()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 386-400

Postprocess the reactor network solutions
=========================================
There are two ways to process the results from a reactor network. You
can extract the solution of an individual reactor member as a stream
by using the ``get_reactor_stream()`` method with the reactor name. Or,
you can get the stream properties of a specific network outlet by using the
``get_external_stream()`` method with the outlet index. Once you get the
solution as a stream, you can use any stream or mixture
method to further manipulate the solutions.

.. note::
  Use the ``number_external_outlets()`` method to find out the number of
  external exists of the reactor network.
