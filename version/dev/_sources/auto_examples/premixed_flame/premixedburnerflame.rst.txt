===========================================
Simulate a burner stabilized premixed flame
===========================================

The *burner stabilized premixed flame* model is frequently used as a numerical tool
to develop and to validate combustion mechanisms in the context of a burner stabilized flat
flame. The premixed burner stabilized flat flame experiments are important because, in addition
to the reaction pathways and rate parameters, they provide opportunities to learn about
the impact of the transport processes on the combustion chemistry and flame structure. The
premixed burner stabilized flame model calculates the temperature and the species concentrations
along the burner centerline, and the results will be compared against the measurements. The
burner stabilized flame model assumes that the flow is laminar and the temperature at the burner
rim is constant (in order to anchor the flame).

This example shows how to use the burner stabilized premixed flame model
to calculate the species profiles of a C\ :sub:`2`\ H\ :sub:`4`\ -O\ :sub:`2`\ -AR mixture along
the burner centerline with the measured temperature profile data. Since the transport
processes are critical for flame calculations, transport data must be included in the mechanism
data and preprocessed.

Create the first chemistry set
==============================
The mechanism to load is the GRI 3.0 mechanism for methane combustion.
This mechanism and its associated data files come with the standard Ansys Chemkin
installation in the ``/reaction/data`` directory.

.. note::
  The transport data *must* be included and preprocessed because the transport processes,
  *convection and diffusion*, are important to sustain the flame structure.

Set up the (C\ :sub:`2`\ H\ :sub:`4` + O\ :sub:`2`\ + AR ) mixture to the flat burner
=====================================================================================
Instantiate a stream named ``premixed`` for the inlet gas mixture.
This stream is a mixture with the addition of the inlet flow rate.
You specify the inlet gas properties in the same way you
set up a mixture. You can simply use a composition *"recipe"* to create
the C\ :sub:`2`\ H\ :sub:`4` + O\ :sub:`2`\ + AR mixture. You use the
``mass_flowrate()`` method to assign the burner inlet mass flow rate.

.. note::
  By default, the burner flow area is set to unity (1.0 [cm\ :sup:`2`\ ]) because the flame
  models use the mass flux [g/cm\ :sup:`2`\ -sec] in the calculations instead of
  the flow rate [g/sec]. If the mass flow rate is used, the actual burner cross-sectional
  flow area must be provided by using the ``flowarea()`` stream method.

Instantiate the laminar flat flame burner
=========================================
Set up the premixed burner stabilized flame model by using the stream
representing the premixed fuel-oxidizer mixture.There are many options
and parameters related to the treatment of the species boundary condition and
the transport properties. All the available options and parameters are described
in the *Chemkin Input* manual.

.. note::
  The stream parameter used to instantiate a ``Burner`` object consists of
  the properties of the unburned fuel-oxidizer mixture leaving the burner outlet.

profile data. The temperature profile along the burner centerline is
typically obtained from the corresponding experiments.

Set up initial mesh and grid adaption options
=============================================
The premixed flame models provides several methods to set up the initial
mesh.  In this case, the temperature profile is given by the experimental data.
The ``use_TPRO_grid()`` method lets the flame model recycle the grid points of
the temperature profile as the initial mesh at the start of the calculation.
The flame models would add more grid points to where they are needed as determined by
the solution quality parameters specified by the ``set_solution_quality()`` method.

The ``end_position`` argument is a required input as it defines the length of the calculation
domain. Typically, the length of the calculation domain is between 1 to 10 [cm].


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 232-242

.. code-block:: Python


    # set the maximum total number of grid points allowed in the calculation (optional)
    flatflame.set_max_grid_points(250)
    # define the calculation domain [cm]
    flatflame.end_position = 1.2
    # maximum number of grid points can be added during each grid adaption event (optional)
    flatflame.set_max_adaptive_points(10)
    # set the maximum values of the gradient and the curvature of the solution profiles (optional)
    flatflame.set_solution_quality(gradient=0.1, curvature=0.1)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 243-256

Set transport property options
===============================
Ansys Chemkin offers three methods for computing mixture properties:

- **Mixture averaged**
- **Multi-component**
- **Constant Lewis number

When the system pressure is not too low, the mixture averaged method should be adequate.
The multi-component method, although it is slightly more accurate, makes the simulation time longer
and is harder to converge. Using the constant Lewis number method implies that all the species
would have the same transport properties.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 256-260

.. code-block:: Python


    # use the mixture averaged method to evaluate the mixture transport properties
    flatflame.use_mixture_averaged_transport()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 261-266

Set species composition boundary option
=======================================
There two types of boundary condition treatments for the species composition available
from the premixed flame models: ``comp`` and ``flux``. You can find the descriptions of
these two treatments in the *Chemkin Input* manual.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 266-271

.. code-block:: Python


    # specify the species composition boundary treatment ('comp' or 'flux')
    # use 'flux' to ensure that the "net" species mass fluxes are zero at the burner outlet.
    flatflame.set_species_boundary_types(mode="flux")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 272-278

Set solver parameters
=====================
The steady-state solver parameters for the premixed flame model are optional because all the
solver parameters have their own default values. Change the solver parameters when the premixed
flame simulation does not converge with the default settings.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 278-284

.. code-block:: Python


    # reset the tolerances in the steady-state solver (optional)
    flatflame.steady_state_tolerances = (1.0e-9, 1.0e-4)
    # reset the gas species floor value in the steady-state solver (optional)
    flatflame.set_species_floor(-1.0e-3)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 285-293

Run the premixed flame calculation
==================================
Use the ``run()`` method to run the freely propagating premixed flame (flame speed) model.
This method solves the reactors one by one in the order that they are added to the network.
After the premixed flame calculation concludes successfully, use the ``process_solution()``
method to postprocess the solutions. You can create other property profiles by looping through the
solution streams with proper mixture methods.

.. code-block:: Python


    # set the start wall time
    start_time = time.time()

    if status != 0:
        print(Color.RED + "Failed to solve the reactor network." + Color.END)
        exit()

    # get the number of solution grid points
    solutionpoints = flatflame.get_solution_size()
    print(f"Number of solution points = {solutionpoints}.")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 307-315

Refine the solution profiles
===============================
When the simulation is hard to converge in one go, you can use a number
of continuations to gradually get to the solution of the intended condition.
For example, you can get to the solution of a very fuel-lean mixture by starting with
a slightly fuel-rich mixture flame and use the ``continuation()`` method to run the more
difficult fuel-lean case from the converged solution.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 315-328

.. code-block:: Python


    # tightening the convergence criteria
    flatflame.set_solution_quality(gradient=0.05, curvature=0.1)

    # restart the flame simulation by continuation
    flatflame.continuation()

    # compute the total runtime
    runtime = time.time() - start_time
    print()
    print(f"Total simulation duration: {runtime} [sec].")
    print()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 329-353

Postprocess the premixed flame results
======================================
The postprocessing step parses the solution and packages the solution values at each
time point into a mixture. There are two ways to access the solution profiles:

- The raw solution profiles (value as a function of distance) are available for distance,
  temperature, pressure, volume, and species mass fractions.

 -The streams permit the use of all property and rate utilities to extract
  information such as viscosity, density, and mole fractions.

You can use the ``get_solution_variable_profile()`` method to get the raw solution profiles. You
solution streams are accessed using either the ``get_solution_stream_at_grid()`` method for the
solution stream at the given grid point or the ``get_solution_stream()`` method for the
solution stream at the given location. (In this case, the stream is constructed by interpolation.)

.. note::

  - Use the ``get_solution_size()`` method to get the number of grid points in the solution
    profiles before creating the arrays.
  - The ``mass_flowrate`` from the solution streams is actually the
    *mass flux* [g/cm\ :sup:`2`\ -sec]. It can used to derive the velocity at the corresponding
    location by dividing it by the local gas mixture density [g/cm\ :sup:`3`\ ].
