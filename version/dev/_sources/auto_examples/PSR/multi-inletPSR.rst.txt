=============================================================
Determine the impact of residence time on combustion in a PSR
=============================================================

Ansys Chemkin offers some idealized reactor models commonly used for studying chemical
processes and for developing reaction mechanisms. The PSR (perfectly stirred reactor) model is
a steady-state 0-D model of the open perfectly mixed gas-phase reactor. There is no limit on
the number of inlets to the PSR. As soon as the inlet gases enter the reactor, they are
thoroughly mixed with the gas mixture inside. The PSR has only one outlet, and the outlet gas
is assumed to be exactly the same as the gas mixture in the PSR. There are two basic types of
PSR models:

- **constrained-pressure** (or set residence time)
- **constrained-volume**

By default, the PSR model is running under constant pressure. The PyChemkin PSR models
always require the connected inlets to be defined, that is, the total inlet flow rate to the PSR
is always known. Therefore, either the residence time or the reactor volume is needed to
satisfy the basic setup of the PSR model.

This example specifies the reactor volume of the PSR. The residence time is calculated from the reactor volume and the total inlet volumetric flow rate.

For each type of PSR model, you can either specify the reactor temperature (as a fixed
value or by a piecewise-linear profile) or solve the energy conservation equation. In total,
you get four variations of the PSR model.

PSR models are mostly employed in chemical kinetics studies. By controlling the reactor
temperature, pressure, and/or residence time, you can gain knowledge about the major intermediates
of a complex chemical process and postulate possible reaction pathways.

This example describes a parameter study of the influence of the PSR residence time on the hydrogen combustion process. It uses two inlet streams, one for the fuel mixture and the other for the air mixture. The fuel-to-air ratio inside the PSR is determined by the mass or the volumetric flow rate ratio of the two inlet streams.

Create a chemistry set
======================
This example uses the encrypted hydrogen-ammonia mechanism, ``Hydrogen-Ammonia-NOx_chem_MFL2021.inp``.
This mechanism is developed under Chemkin's **Model Fuel Library (MFL)** project.
Like the rest of the MFL mechanisms, it is located in ``ModelFuelLibrary`` in
the ``/reaction/data`` directory of the standard Ansys Chemkin installation.

Set up the fuel and air streams
===============================
Instantiate a stream named ``fuel`` for the inlet stream containing
the fuel mixture and a stream named ``air`` for the inlet stream
containing the air mixture. The ``Inlet`` object is a mixture with the addition of the
inlet flow rate.

You specify inlet gas properties in the same way as you set up a mixture. Here, the ``fuel`` and
``air`` inlets are created separately. You can adjust their inlet volumetric flow rates to create
the desired hydrogen-air mixture. You use the ``vol_flowrate()`` method to assign the inlet
volumetric flow rate. In this project, the ``fuel`` and ``air`` inlets
have fixed volumetric flow rates of 25 and 50 [cm3/sec], respectively.

.. note ::
  This equation is used to determine the hydrogen-to-oxygen molar ratio:

  .. math ::
      H_{2}:O_{2}=0.21[cm^3/cm^3]*25[cm^3/s]:0.21[cm^3/cm^3]*50[cm^3/s]=1:2

.. note ::
  The PSR residence time is specified indirectly through the reactor volume
  in the parameter study.

Create the PSR to predict the gas composition of the outlet stream
==================================================================
Use the ``PSR_SetVolume_EnergyConservation()`` method to instantiate a PSR
named ``combustor``. You must include the energy equation because the goal is to
see how the residence time would affect the hydrogen combustion process.
The ``combustor`` PSR is initiated with the parameter set to the ``fuel`` inlet,
Hence, the gas property of the ``fuel`` inlet is applied
as the estimated reactor condition of the ``combustor`` PSR. You can overwrite
any estimated reactor conditions by using appropriate methods. For example,
``combustor.temperature = 2000.0`` changes the estimated reactor temperature
from 450 (the temperature of the ``fuel`` inlet) to 2000 [K]. The ``volume()``
method sets the reactor volume of the nominal case.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 177-182

.. code-block:: Python


    # create a PSR with fixed reactor volume and
    # with the fuel inlet composition as the estimated reactor condition
    combustor = PSR(fuel, label="tincan")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 183-189

Set up additional reactor model parameters
==========================================
You must provide reactor parameters, solver controls, and output instructions
before running the simulations. For the steady-state PSR, you must provide either
the residence time or the reactor volume. You can also make changes to any estimated reactor
conditions if desired.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 189-195

.. code-block:: Python


    # reset the estimated reactor temperature [K]
    combustor.temperature = 2000.0
    # set the reactor volume (cm3): required for PSR_SetVolume_EnergyConservation model
    combustor.volume = 200.0


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 196-203

Connect the inlets to the reactor
=================================
You must connect at least one inlet to the open reactor. Use the ``set_inlet()`` method to
add a stream object to the PSR. Inversely, use the ``remove_inlet()`` to disconnect an inlet
from the PSR. Here two inlets, ``fuel`` and ``air``, are connected to the ``combustor`` PSR. The
fuel-to-air ratio is controlled by the mass or the volumetric flow rate ratio of the ``fuel``
and the ``air`` inlets.

    # add external inlets to the PSR
    combustor.set_inlet(fuel)
    combustor.set_inlet(air)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 209-217

Set solver controls
===================
You can overwrite the default solver controls by using solver-related methods, such as
those for tolerances. The following code changes the tolerances that the steady-state
solver is to use for the steady-state search and changes the pseudo time stepping stages.
Sometimes, during the iterations, some species mass fractions might become negative,
causing the solver to report an error and stop. To overcome this issue, you can provide
a small cushion to allow species mass fractions to go slightly negative by using the # ``set_species_floor()`` method to reset the mass fraction floor value.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 217-224

.. code-block:: Python


    # reset the tolerances in the steady-state solver
    combustor.steady_state_tolerances = (1.0e-9, 1.0e-6)
    combustor.timestepping_tolerances = (1.0e-9, 1.0e-6)
    # reset the gas species floor value in the steady-state solver
    combustor.set_species_floor(-1.0e-10)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 225-241

Run the PSR residence time parameter study
==========================================
The PSR residence time :math:`\tau` is calculated as follows:

.. math ::

  \tau = \frac{reactor\text{ }volume}{total\text{ }volumetric\text{ }flow\text{ }rate}

In this parameter study, the reactor volume is decreased from 200 to
160 [cm3]. Accordingly, :math:`\tau` is decreased from
2.67 to 2.13 [sec] because the total inlet volumetric flow rate is kept
constant at 75 [cm3/sec]. Usually you want to run the burning cases
(large residence times) first in the PSR parameter study.

The ``process_solution`` method converts the result from each PSR run to a mixture.
You can either overwrite the solution mixture or use a new one for each simulation result.

Plot the parameter study results
================================
Plot the predicted PSR temperature against the residence time. You can observe
that the hydrogen-air mixture ceases to burn when the residence time becomes
too small. Gas turbine terminology refers to this as *blown out*
because the fuel-air mixture gets blown out of the combustor before any
significant chemical reaction can take place.
