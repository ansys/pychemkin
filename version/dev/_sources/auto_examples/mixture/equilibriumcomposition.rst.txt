=================================================================================
Estimate the steady-state NO emission level of a complete burned fuel-air mixture
=================================================================================

This example shows how to quickly estimate the steady-state NO level
that is formed by the combustion of a fuel-air mixture at a given temperature.
Without needing any reaction, the NO concentration gets to its steady state
(or the maximum level) when the product mixture from the fuel-air combustion
reaches the equilibrium state at the given temperature. To find the equilibrium state of
the fresh fuel-air mixture, the ``equilibrium()`` method is used with the ``fixed pressure``
and ``fixed temperature`` options.

This example explores the influence of temperature on the predicted adiabatic flame temperature.
Knowing that nitrogen oxides (NOx) are stable at high temperatures (> 2000 [K]),
you can expect that the steady-state NO level should increase sharply when the temperature
gets high enough.

Create a chemistry set
======================
The first mechanism to load is the GRI 3.0 mechanism for methane combustion.
This mechanism and its associated data files come with the standard Ansys Chemkin
installation in the ``/reaction/data`` directory.

    # create a chemistry set based on GRI 3.0
    MyGasMech = ck.Chemistry(label="GRI 3.0")
    # set mechanism input files
    # including the full file path is recommended

Preprocess the chemistry set
============================

Set up gas mixtures
===================
Set up gas mixtures based on the species in this chemistry set.
PyChemkin provides a few methods for creating a gas mixture. Here,
the ``isothermal_mixing()`` method is used to create a ``fuel-air`` mixture
by mixing the ``fuel`` and ``air`` mixtures with a predetermined
air/fuel rate.

Create a fuel mixture
=====================
Create a fuel mixture of 80% methane and 20% hydrogen.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-113

.. code-block:: Python


    fuel = ck.Mixture(MyGasMech)
    # set mole fraction
    fuel.X = [("CH4", 0.8), ("H2", 0.2)]
    fuel.temperature = 300.0
    fuel.pressure = ck.P_ATM  # 1 atm

Create an air mixture
=====================
Create an air mixture of oxygen and nitrogen.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 117-125

.. code-block:: Python


    air = ck.Mixture(MyGasMech)
    # set mass fraction
    air.Y = [("O2", 0.23), ("N2", 0.77)]
    air.temperature = 300.0
    air.pressure = ck.P_ATM  # 1 atm



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 126-133

Create a fuel-air mixture by mixing
===================================
Use the ``isothermal_mixing()`` method to mix the ``fuel`` and ``air`` mixtures created earlier.
Define the mixing formula using ``mixture_recipe`` with this mass ratio: ``fuel:air=1.00:17.19``.
Use the ``finaltemperature`` parameter to set the temperature of the
new ``premixed`` mixture to 300 [K]. Set ``mode="mass"`` because
the ratios given in ``mixture_recipe`` are mass ratios.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 133-140

.. code-block:: Python


    mixture_recipe = [(fuel, 1.0), (air, 17.19)]
    # create the new mixture (the air-fuel ratio is by mass)
    premixed = ck.isothermal_mixing(
        recipe=mixture_recipe, mode="mass", finaltemperature=300.0
    )

Find the equilibrium composition at different temperatures
==========================================================
Perform the equilibrium calculation with fixed pressure and
fixed temperature. The NO mole fraction of the equilibrium state
at each temperature is stored in an array. The gas temperature
is increased from 500 to 2480 [K].

    points = 100

    # start the temperature loop

        # find the equilibrium state mixture at the given mixture temperature and pressure
        eqstate = ck.equilibrium(premixed, opt=1)
